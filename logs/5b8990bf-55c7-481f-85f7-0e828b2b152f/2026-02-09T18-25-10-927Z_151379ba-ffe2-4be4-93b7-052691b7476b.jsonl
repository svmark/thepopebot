Globe\nLink: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/02/08/business/get-ready-for-double-whammy-of-us-jobs-and-inflation/\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The January jobs report on Wednesday and the consumer price index, due Friday, are unusually close together after the government shutdown.\nContent:\nAs for the regular monthly figures, economists predict payrolls rose 69,000 in January. Such an outcome would be the best in four months and offer some reassurance against further softening in the labor market. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.4%, near a four-year high.\n\nGet Starting Point\n\nA guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday.\n\nEnter Email\n\nIn the CPI data, economists will look for more evidence that inflation is on a downward trend after previous reports were complicated by last year’s record-long government shutdown. Forecasters expect an underlying metric of inflation — which excludes food and energy costs — to rise at the slowest annual pace since early 2021.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates steady in January given signs of stabilization in the labor market and inflation that’s still elevated. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, who both dissented in favor of another rate cut, will speak in the coming week.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n\n“For payrolls, we estimate the BLS benchmark revision will lower the level for March 2025 by about 650K jobs — somewhat less pessimistic than the consensus. January’s jobs print may surprise on the low side, as the BLS’s modifies its ‘birth and death’ model to account for recent hiring weakness.”\n\n—Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Chris G. Collins, Alex Tanzi and Troy Durie, economists. For full analysis, click here\n\nGovernment figures on Tuesday are projected to show another month of solid retail sales in December. Despite elevated anxiety about the high cost of living and the shaky job market, household spending has been resilient — a trend that many economists expect to endure in the near term as annual tax refunds roll out.\n\nWhile household spending growth has been solid, the housing market remains bogged down by affordability constraints. National Association of Realtors data due on Thursday will probably show sales of previously owned homes declined in January.\n\n* For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US\n\nLooking north, the Bank of Canada’s summary of deliberations will offer insight into its decision to hold rates steady for a second consecutive meeting, while warning that heightened uncertainty made its next move hard to predict. Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers will speak on Thursday about how artificial intelligence is impacting the economy.\n\nElsewhere, Japan’s election, inflation data from China to Switzerland to Brazil, gross domestic product in the UK, and rate decisions from Russia to Peru may focus investors.\n\nClick here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.\n\nAsia\n\nChina sets the tone early with January credit data, including new yuan loans, aggregate financing, and money supply figures.\n\nInvestors want to see whether easier policy is translating into stronger economic momentum. Inflation readings later in the week, including producer and consumer prices due Wednesday, should help clarify whether deflationary pressures are easing or becoming more entrenched.\n\nFresh off a national election, Japan gets a big batch of data on Monday, with cash earnings and real wage data for December expected to shed light on whether income growth is fueling prices. Balance-of-payments figures are released the same day, while machinery orders later in the week will offer an update on capital spending momentum.\n\nIn Australia, attention turns to domestic demand indicators arriving Tuesday, including household spending for December and consumer confidence readings. The figures land a week after the Reserve Bank’s hawkish pivot.\n\nSouth Korea has January unemployment data on Wednesday.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the spotlight turns to growth. Malaysia releases fourth-quarter GDP on Friday, alongside current-account figures, offering insight into domestic demand.\n\nIndia publishes January inflation on Thursday, a key test for the Reserve Bank of India as it weighs the scope for easing later this year. Food prices remain a swing factor, and any upside surprise could complicate the policy outlook.\n\nIn sum, the week’s data will help determine whether Asia’s cooling inflation narrative is intact — or whether, as Australia’s experience shows, central banks risk being pushed into a more stop-start policy path as growth and prices diverge across the region.\n\n* For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\n\nFollowing the Bank of England’s close vote against a rate cut — and Governor Andrew Bailey’s apparent endorsement of bets on a 50% chance of a March move — data in the coming week will reveal the strength of the economy in the fourth quarter. Most analysts predict only a slight acceleration to growth of 0.2% from the prior three months.\n\nOfficials scheduled to speak include key voters including Bailey himself on Sunday and Catherine Mann on Monday.

This includes the [nonfarm payrolls](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/january-jobs-report-government-shutdown.html) report for January, which was initially scheduled for last Friday, but which the Bureau of Labor Statistics will now release on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe report is forecast to show a gain of 60,000 jobs for the month, after a 50,000 increase in December, per economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate is projected to hold steady at 4.4%.\n\nThe January consumer price index reading, also delayed by the shutdown, is due out on Friday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones except that the annual inflation rate eased to 2.5%.\n\nIn addition to these reports, investors will await retail sales for December on Tuesday and weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday. There's also a full menu of Federal Reserve speakers during the week, with Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran on tap Monday.\n\nThe market also was watching news out of China, where authorities urged banks to pull back from the U.S. Treasury market on concerns of concentration risk and volatility, according to a [Bloomberg News report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/china-urges-banks-to-limit-holdings-of-us-treasuries-citing-market-volatility).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62 points, or 0.1 per cent, as of 9:35 a.m.\n\nEastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent, AP reported.The softer start followed a sharp surge in Asian markets, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 3.9 per cent to a record high after the ruling party secured a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. Investors expect the political outcome to strengthen Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s ability to push economic and market reforms.On Wall Street, markets paused after Friday’s strong rally, which marked the best session since May.\n\nHowever, concerns continue to linger over stretched valuations, with the S&P 500 still trading near its all-time high set last month.Investors are also increasingly questioning whether heavy spending by Big Tech and other companies on artificial intelligence will generate sufficient profits to justify the scale of investments.Volatility across other asset classes showed signs of easing after recent sharp swings.\n\nBitcoin slipped below $69,000 after briefly crossing $71,000 over the weekend, having dropped close to $60,000 last week, more than halfway below its record high hit in October.Gold rose 1.2 per cent to move back above $5,000 per ounce, continuing sharp price swings after roughly doubling over the past year. Silver also advanced 3 per cent, extending its volatile trading pattern.Among stocks, Kroger gained 6.1 per cent after appointing a former Walmart executive as its new chief executive officer.\n\nWorkday fell 5.9 per cent after announcing CEO Carl Eschenbach would step down, with co-founder Aneel Bhusri set to return to the role.Transocean slipped 1 per cent after announcing plans to acquire Valaris in an all-stock deal valued at $5.8 billion, while Valaris shares surged 22.3 per cent.In bond markets, US Treasury yields remained largely steady ahead of key economic data due later this week, including monthly jobs data on Wednesday and consumer inflation data on Friday.\n\nBoth reports are expected to shape expectations around the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook.The Fed has paused rate cuts for now, but a weaker labour market could accelerate easing, while persistently high inflation could delay further rate reductions.The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.22 per cent.Across global markets, Asian equities rallied strongly, led by Japan. South Korea’s Kospi surged 4.1 per cent, while Hong Kong rose 1.8 per cent and Shanghai gained 1.4 per cent.

The move extends a sharp early-February rebound after a volatile start to 2026 that has seen unusually wide daily swings across metals.\n\nAs of **11:30 a.m. ET on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026**, spot gold was around **$4,961 per troy ounce**, up roughly **4%** from the prior session’s close.\n\n## Gold price today: where the market stands\n\nGold’s latest push higher has been driven by two familiar forces that often tug in opposite directions: currency moves that can support bullion demand and interest rates that can increase the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset. This time, gold is rising even with yields elevated, suggesting demand has been resilient enough to offset rate pressure.\n\nA key detail is the recent volatility. Gold hit a fresh record high earlier in January, then dropped sharply before rebounding this week. That kind of whipsaw price action can attract short-term momentum buying while also pulling in longer-term hedging demand from investors worried about macro risk.\n\n| Market snapshot | Level | Time reference (ET) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Spot gold (approx.) | $4,961/oz | 11:30 a.m., Feb. 7 |\n| Gold futures (Apr. 2026, approx.) | $4,989/oz | Latest session |\n| U.S. Dollar Index (DXY, approx.) | 97.6 | Prior close |\n| U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (approx.) | 4.22% | Prior close |\n\n## What’s driving the move\n\nThree overlapping themes are shaping gold’s bid:\n\n**1) The dollar has eased.** \nA softer dollar tends to make gold cheaper for non-U.S. buyers and can lift demand at the margin. Even modest declines can matter when gold is moving in $50–$150 daily increments.\n\n**2) Rate expectations are being repriced.** \nGold can rise with yields when the market believes inflation risks, fiscal concerns, or financial-stability worries are rising faster than real (inflation-adjusted) returns. Recent curve dynamics have also kept attention on the longer end of the Treasury market, which can spill into precious metals positioning.\n\n**3) Risk hedging remains active.** \nGold’s role as a hedge is not limited to inflation. It can also attract flows on concerns about government borrowing paths, geopolitical uncertainty, or market drawdowns elsewhere. When multiple narratives are in play at once, gold often trades more on positioning and sentiment than on any single data point.\n\n## Technical levels traders are watching\n\nWith spot prices near $5,000, the market is hovering around a round-number psychological threshold that can amplify short-term moves. When prices approach levels like $5,000, two things tend to happen:\n\n* **Profit-taking** emerges from traders who rode the rebound and want to lock gains.\n \n* **Breakout buying** appears if the market convincingly clears the level, forcing short positions to cover and drawing in trend-followers.\n \n\nOn the downside, traders will focus on whether gold can hold recent rebound support in the mid-$4,700s to $4,800s. If that floor breaks, price action could revert to the kind of fast, air-pocket declines seen earlier in the year.\n\n## What this means for U.S. investors and consumers\n\nFor U.S. investors, a surge in spot prices can show up quickly in gold-backed funds and futures-linked products, but entry points become trickier when intraday ranges are large. In practical terms, risk management matters more than usual: position sizes, stop levels, and holding periods can determine outcomes as much as the direction call.\n\nFor consumers, higher spot prices can translate into pricier bullion coins and bars, and potentially higher jewelry prices with a lag. Retail premiums can widen during periods of heavy demand or when supply chains tighten, meaning the “street” price can move even faster than spot.\n\n## The near-term calendar to watch\n\nGold’s next push could hinge on two catalysts: upcoming U.S. economic releases that affect rate expectations, and Treasury market events that influence the dollar and real yields. If yields rise sharply without a matching increase in inflation expectations, gold can face headwinds. If the dollar weakens further or risk sentiment deteriorates, gold can keep finding bids even at elevated levels.\n\nThe market’s message right now is straightforward: gold is acting less like a sleepy inflation hedge and more like a high-volatility macro asset. That can reward the right call—but it also punishes complacency.\n\nSources consulted: Investing.com, Trading Economics, MarketWatch, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770661546437}}

The bright metal takes advantage of broad weakness in the US Dollar (USD) and gains ground despite a generally optimistic market mood.\n\nThe USD decline started in Asia and resulted from the Japanese Yen (JPY) strength after the outcome of local elections. Prime Minister (PM) Sanae Takaichi called for a snap election last month, seeking increased support for her policies. The result was beyond any expectation as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secured 316 out of 465 seats in the lower house, the first time a party won two-thirds of the house since the parliament was established.\n\nOther than that, financial markets had little to work with. Investors are waiting for the United States (US) data.

Last week's peak at around $5,092 stands as an immediate barrier, yet once beyond it, XAU/USD is likely to grind back toward record highs.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, readings in the 4-hour chart support the bullish case. The pair has advanced above a bullish 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which has turned higher right below a flat 100-period SMA. The 100 SMA provides support at $4,954, followed by the 20 SMA at $4,928. At the same time, technical indicators accelerated north within positive levels, in line with increased buying interest.\n\nIn the daily chart, XAU/USD managed to firm up above all bullish moving averages. The 20-day SMA accelerated north, currently standing at around $4,890. Meanwhile, the Momentum indicator has partially lost its upward strength but holds well above its midline, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator advances at around 59, favoring the upside without confirming another leg north.\n\n_(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)_\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Silver Spot Price Chart | Live Updates | BullionVault\nLink: https://www.bullionvault.com/silver-price-chart.do\nAge: 18 hours ago\nSnippet: You can then use these real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault&#x27;s live order board, selecting your silver market from Zurich, London, Toronto or Singapore.

Discover the key drivers behind this movement as well as our expert analysis in the detailed breakdown below.\n\n## Quick Financial Overview\n\nValaris Limited has reported significant financial data for the year, providing insights that will be pivotal during its Q4 2025 earnings conference. Valaris recently closed at $76.05, showcasing stability amid market movements. Across the past few months, the stock had some notable fluctuations. In early February, it surged from around $55.9 to over $76, emphasizing the sensitivity of prices to market and internal events.\n\nFinancial metrics highlight Valaris’s strengths and challenges. A mixed valuation emerges through key ratios: a gross margin of 67.3% indicates solid cost management, while a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.16 suggests an attractive valuation compared to industry peers. Although the company has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 0.44, which signals leverage reliance, its current ratio of 1.9 and quick ratio of 1.7 denote a stable liquidity position.\n\n#### More Breaking News\n\n* [Coupang Faces Massive Lawsuit Wave Over Major Data Breach​](https://stockstotrade.com/news/coupang-inc-cpng-news-2026_02_05/)\n* [Regal Rexnord’s Price Target Boosts Market Confidence](https://stockstotrade.com/news/regal-rexnord-corporation-rrx-news-2026_02_05/)\n* [Vizsla Silver Corp.

The price surge came without the backing of a major earnings report, product launch, or regulatory change.\nContent:\nMDJM (Nasdaq: UOKA) stock news has dominated pre-market chatter as shares of the micro-cap surged 78.99% to $2.13, breaking sharply from a previous close of $1.19. That move — one of the largest percentage gains in recent memory for this volatile stock — has sparked immediate questions about the cause and sustainability of the rally.\n\nThe move isn’t tied to a clear fundamental catalyst like earnings or an acquisition. Rather, the surge appears to be driven by microstructure volatility — sharp swings in thinly traded names where even small orders can create outsized price movements. UOKA’s price action shows signs of being a self-fulfilling technical trade, where a breakout from a recent range attracted speculative attention. Still, the lack of institutional confirmation in the form of high volume raises red flags about the durability of the rally.\n\n## Why Is [UOKA](https://chart.ainvest.com/NASDAQ-UOKA/)[UOKA\\--](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-UOKA/) Stock Soaring?\n\nMDJM (UOKA) stock news has traders buzzing over a 79% jump in pre-market trading — but the reason is far from straightforward. The price surge came without the backing of a major earnings report, product launch, or regulatory change. Instead, UOKA appears to be behaving more like a momentum trade than a fundamental rerating.\n\n![](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1770641103136.jpg.png?format=webp&width=700)\n\nThe stock’s current price of $2.13 is well above the 20-day high of $2.90 but still below the 60-day high of $3.30. This puts UOKA in the mid-range of its 60-day price distribution, suggesting the move is more about internal volatility than a shift in the stock’s broader trend.\n\nThe move is also notable for its speed. In just one pre-market session, UOKA jumped from a previous close of $1.19 to trade at $2.13, a move that would typically take weeks in a more liquid stock. This kind of rapid reversal in a micro-cap often signals short-term speculative positioning rather than a sustained shift in sentiment.\n\nThat said, the sharp move could still attract follow-through buying if the stock holds above key technical levels. But with volume still well below average, and the stock yet to break above its 50-day moving average of $2.19, the signal remains mixed at best.\n\n## What’s Driving the Volatility in UOKA? Market Structure or Micro-Cap Noise?\n\nThe volatility in UOKA is more about market structure than fundamental news. Micro-cap stocks like UOKA are prone to sharp, unexplained swings because of low liquidity and concentrated ownership. In this case, the lack of a clear catalyst points to the stock being used as a speculative vehicle, possibly by algorithmic or high-frequency trading strategies that take advantage of thin order books.\n\nThe price action in UOKA is textbook for a self-fulfilling technical trade — a sharp breakout that attracts buyers looking to ride the momentum. That’s not always a bad strategy, but in a stock like UOKA, it often ends in a quick reversal once the initial euphoria fades. The stock’s recent price history shows it trading in a tight range for much of 2025 before a sudden spike in volatility around the beginning of 2026.\n\nEven so, the move does raise the question: is this a true breakout or just noise? The answer likely lies in how UOKA performs in the next few sessions. If the stock can hold above $2.19 — the 50-day moving average and a key resistance level — it could signal a shift in sentiment. But if it fails to maintain that level, it could signal a false breakout.\n\n## What to Watch for in UOKA: Key Levels and Scenarios\n\nMDJM (UOKA) stock news should be viewed through the lens of its technical structure. The most immediate levels to watch are $2.00 (a key support) and $2.19 (a key resistance). A break below $2.00 would signal a return to a weaker structure, while a sustained move above $2.19 could indicate a new trend is forming.\n\nLooking at UOKA support and resistance levels, the stock is in a precarious position. It’s currently sitting just below its 50-day MA and still well below its 200-day MA. This suggests the move is more about short-term momentum than a fundamental shift. Still, if the stock can close above $2.19 and hold it, it could open the door to a test of the 60-day high at $3.30.\n\nThe most likely near-term scenario is a failure or false breakout. This would play out if UOKA struggles to hold above $2.19 and then sees a pullback to retest the $2.00 support level. A break of $2.00 would increase the probability of a deeper retest, possibly down to the $1.73 level (the 20-day MA). On the other hand, a successful breakout above $2.19 could bring in new buyers and shift the structure from a mean-reversion setup to a potential breakout trend.\n\nIn any case, the move in UOKA highlights the risks and opportunities in micro-cap trading. These stocks can offer explosive returns — but they’re also prone to sharp, unexplained reversals. For now, the focus should be on whe\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Stock Movers: Novo Nordisk, Natwest, InPost - Bloomberg\nLink: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2026-02-09/stock-movers-novo-nordisk-natwest-inpost-podcast\nAge: 9 hours ago\nSnippet: Today&#x27;s biggest winners and losers in the stock market.
