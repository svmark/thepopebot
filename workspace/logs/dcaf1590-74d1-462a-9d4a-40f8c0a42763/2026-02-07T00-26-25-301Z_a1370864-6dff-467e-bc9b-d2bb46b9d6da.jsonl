Here’s why:\n\n* Nerves about AI tools disrupting business models are hurting software stocks.\n* Investors are becoming skeptical about Big Tech’s massive spending spree on building data centers to power the AI boom.\n* Tech stocks were already expensive from big gains in recent years, making them susceptible to a “shoot first and ask questions later” sell-off.\n* The AI tide lifted all boats for a while; now, Wall Street has to get picky about winners and losers.\n\n“Recent months have seen a shift from the ‘every tech stock is a winner’ mindset to a more brutal landscape of winners and losers,” Jim Reid, head of global macro research at Deutsche Bank, said in a Thursday note.\n\nA sell-off in risky assets like bitcoin — which just hit its [lowest level since October 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/05/investing/bitcoin-price) — also probably fueled investors’ desire for safer assets earlier this week. Bitcoin rebounded Friday, soaring 10% to roughly $70,000.\n\n“Stocks are off to a volatile start in February,” Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth, said in a note.\n\n“The bull market is not dead, but it is aging, and we are not surprised to see investors paying more attention to corporate earnings and profitability,” Bellin said.\n\nAI startup Anthropic on Friday released new tools that the company says can do more tasks for the legal industry. That [made Wall Street nervous](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/04/investing/us-stocks-anthropic-software) that companies will soon be able to dump their existing, specialized subscriptions to data analytics and research software, directly hurting software companies’ bottom lines.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether that will actually happen. But investors were spooked and dumped shares in legal and financial software and services companies.\n\nThere have been nerves about AI eating into software’s market share for a while: Salesforce ([CRM](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/CRM)), a software company in the blue-chip Dow index, slumped 20% in 2025 and is down 28% so far this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street is in the midst of corporate earnings season. There are lingering concerns (remember [nerves about an AI bubble?](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/19/tech/ai-chips-lifecycle-questions)) about Big Tech’s aspirations to build out massive data centers and infrastructure to power the AI boom and uncertainty about just how profitable that building rush will prove.\n\nMicrosoft ([MSFT](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/MSFT)), Alphabet ([GOOG](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/GOOG)) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/AMZN)) all outlined plans across the past week to increase their spending on building data centers and infrastructure.\n\nWall Street wants to see evidence that these enormous expenditures will result in actual profits. Microsoft shares dropped 10% on January 29 after the company reported earnings. Amazon shares fell roughly 5.6% Friday after the company’s reported earnings Thursday afternoon.\n\n“The bar for Big Tech remains extremely high,” Seana Smith, senior investment strategist at Global X ETFs, told CNN.\n\n“Markets are only rewarding AI investment when it is paired with clear, durable revenue growth,” Smith said.\n\nThe AI theme has driven the stock market higher across the past three years. Some investors are balking at paying those high prices and are instead looking for off-ramps.\n\nShares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/AMD)) on Wednesday sank 17% and had their worst day since 2017 after the company forecast slightly less revenue in the first quarter than analysts had expected. AMD shares rebounded 8% on Friday.\n\nValuations, a measure of how pricey stocks are, have been elevated for some tech companies. Palantir ([PLTR](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/PLTR)), a star of the AI trade, surged 340% in 2024 and 135% in 2025. Palantir is now down 35% from its record high in early November.\n\nOracle shares ([ORCL](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/ORCL)) [hit a record high](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/tech/oracle-larry-ellison-ai-computing) on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Oracle shares have tanked 59% since then.\n\n“Crowded trades are difficult to exit,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note. “Assets that have been granted premium valuations, whether through rational expectations or speculative fervor, are more prone to messy selloffs if perceptions and/or momentum change.”\n\n## Winners and losers\n\nIn recent years, anything related to AI has been a hot trade on Wall Street. But now investors need to get picky about specific companies they think will benefit.\n\n“Consensus about software companies has flipped to them being AI victims, not beneficiaries,” Sosnick at Interactive Brokers told CNN.\n\n“The rising tide surrounding AI was lifting a lot of boats,” Sosnick said. “Now it’s forcing Wall Street to be much more selective and really decide who are the winners and losers. And that’s going to require a lot more detailed analysis, rather than just sort of riding the momentum train.”\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said this week the idea that software will be replaced by AI was “illogical,” according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidias-huang-dismisses-fears-ai-will-replace-software-tools-stock-selloff-2026-02-04/).\n\nBarclays backs up that sentiment. “It just does not seem realistic” that AI companies can supplant those industry-specific software tools, wrote Nick Dempsey, direct of media equity research at Barclays, in a note. But with markets this touchy, headlines about the possibility are “clearly not helpful,” he added.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund tracking the software industry rose roughly 3% on Friday, pausing an eight-day slide.\n\n“At this point, the negativity surrounding AI-related tech is getting pretty intense,” Tom Essaye, president of Sevens Report Research, said in a note.\n\n“Granted, there are reasons for the skepticism, but the declines in some of these stocks are substantial, and if AI is more resilient than expected (which has been the case in each test so far over the past three years), then there are opportunities \\[for buying\\] developing,” Essaye said.\n\nSeparately, chipmakers also gained Friday as Big Tech’s plans for data centers will likely boost demand for semiconductor chips. Nvidia shares ([NVDA](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/NVDA)) soared 7.78% and had their best day since April.\n\n“When you pull the beach ball underwater that quickly in places like Big Tech, certainly software and semis, the bounce back can be breathtaking,” Chris Galipeau, senior market strategist at Franklin Templeton, told CNN.\n\nCNN’s Matt Egan contributed reporting\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770424011647}}

The new bearish AI sentiment has bled into the wider tech sector, with a risk-off shift gripping investors in the last few days.\n\nWhile some commentators argue the [software crash is overblown](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-tech-stocks-wall-street-sentiment-software-nasdaq-sell-off-2026-2), including [Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-software-tech-stocks-sell-off-nvidia-jensen-huang-illogical-2026-2), others frame it as a [healthy rotation away from tech](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-stocks-software-sell-off-rotation-cyclicals-jpmorgan-ai-sp500-2026-2).\n\nPiper Sandler analysts are in the \"rotation nation\" camp, seeing the tech sell-off as a shift to \"old economy\" plays in cyclical and value shares.\n\n\"The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 1,200 points to close above 50,000 for the first time in history. The S&P 500 posted its best day since May, rising 2%, while the Nasdaq gained 2.18%. The rally was driven by dip-buying in semiconductors, a rotation into \"old economy\" sectors, and resilient investor confidence that the bull market remains intact despite growing skepticism around AI software valuations.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Major Index Performance\n\n| Index | Close | Change | % Change | Notable |\n|-------|-------|--------|----------|---------|\n| **Dow Jones Industrial Average** | 50,115.67 | +1,206.95 | **+2.47%** | First close above 50,000 ever |\n| **S&P 500** | 6,932.30 | +134.04 | **+1.97%** | Best day since May 2025 |\n| **Nasdaq Composite** | 23,031.21 | +490.74 | **+2.18%** | Best day since November 2025 |\n\n### Weekly Performance\n- **Dow**: +2.5% for the week, snapping a three-week losing streak\n- **S&P 500**: Down for the third time in four weeks despite Friday's rally\n- **Nasdaq**: Down ~1.8% for the week, extending its losing streak to four consecutive weeks\n\n### Year-to-Date Performance\n- **Dow**: +4%\n- **S&P 500**: +1%\n- **Nasdaq**: -2%\n\n*Sources: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-and-p-500-02062026-11901010)*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Factors Driving the Rebound\n\n### 2.1 Dip-Buying After an Oversold Condition\n\nThe Nasdaq had experienced its worst three-day slide since April, shedding more than $1.5 trillion in market value during the week before Friday's session. This extreme selling pressure created an oversold condition that attracted bargain hunters.\n\n> \"When you pull the beach ball underwater that quickly in places like Big Tech, certainly software and semis, the bounce back can be breathtaking.\" — **Chris Galipeau, Senior Market Strategist, Franklin Templeton** ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n### 2.2 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Comments on AI Demand\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC that demand for AI chips has been \"going through the roof\" and that the AI industry could be reaching an \"inflection point.\" He described the current buildout as potentially the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" His comments helped reassure semiconductor investors and sent the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) up nearly 6%.\n\n> \"This is probably one of the greatest technological revolutions that we've ever experienced.\" — **Jeremy Siegel, Wharton Professor Emeritus** ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html))\n\n### 2.3 Broader Market Rotation into Value and Cyclicals\n\nCapital has been rotating out of high-multiple tech and growth stocks into \"old economy\" sectors — energy, industrials, materials, consumer staples, and banks. This rotation has provided a floor for the broader market even as tech sold off.\n\n### 2.4 Resilient Earnings Season\n\nThe S&P 500 has reported aggregate year-over-year earnings growth of 10.1% for Q4 2025, with estimates pointing toward 13% EPS growth. This strong earnings backdrop provided fundamental support for the bounce.\n\n### 2.5 Bitcoin and Crypto Recovery\n\nBitcoin, which had plunged to near $60,000 overnight (its lowest since October 2024), rebounded sharply to above $70,700 by market close. This recovery in risk assets helped improve overall market sentiment.\n\n*Sources: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-and-p-500-02062026-11901010)*\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Economic News, Earnings & Policy Announcements\n\n### 5.1 Earnings Season Highlights\n\n**Amazon (AMZN)** — Reported Q4 earnings Thursday after the bell. Revenue met expectations, but the company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of **$200 billion** — a 50% year-over-year increase and ~$50 billion more than Wall Street expected. Operating income guidance fell short. Shares dropped ~5.5% Friday.\n\n**Big Tech AI Spending Recap** (past two weeks):\n- **Alphabet & Meta**: 2026 infrastructure spending ~2x 2025 levels\n- **Amazon**: $200B capex forecast for 2026\n- **Microsoft**: Capital spending expected consistent with last quarter (60%+ YoY increase)\n\n**Other Earnings Movers:**\n- **Roblox (RBLX)**: Beat expectations, shares +10%\n- **Molina Healthcare (MOH)**: Missed estimates badly, shares -26%\n- **Stellantis (STLA)**: Announced €22+ billion in charges from EV strategy reversal, preliminary net loss of €19-21 billion, no dividend — shares -25%\n- **Monolithic Power (MPWR)**: Revenue +21% YoY to $751M on data center demand, shares +5%\n\n### 5.2 The Anthropic/AI Software Disruption Catalyst\n\nThe week's broader selloff was triggered by **Anthropic's release of new Claude Cowork plugins** (late January/early February) demonstrating autonomous capabilities in legal review, accounting, and coding tasks. This sparked fears that AI agents could cannibalize SaaS subscription models, leading to a **~$1 trillion wipeout** in software and services stocks over the week.\n\n> \"Consensus about software companies has flipped to them being AI victims, not beneficiaries.\" — **Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist, Interactive Brokers** ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n**Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang** pushed back, calling the idea that AI will replace software \"illogical.\"\n\n### 5.3 Federal Reserve Commentary\n\nTwo Fed officials gave contrasting assessments on Friday:\n- **Fed Governor Philip Jefferson** (Brookings Institution): Expressed \"cautious optimism,\" noting the unemployment rate at 4.4% has \"changed little,\" suggesting job market stabilization.\n- **SF Fed President Mary Daly**: Highlighted that working households don't feel optimistic, with consumer surveys showing expectations of rising unemployment and scarcer jobs.\n\n### 5.4 Consumer Sentiment\n\nA U.S. survey showed consumer sentiment improved marginally in early February, though lingering worries about the labor market and rising cost of living persist.\n\n### 5.5 Other Market Data\n\n| Asset | Level | Change |\n|-------|-------|--------|\n| 10-Year Treasury Yield | 4.21% | +3 bps |\n| WTI Crude Oil | $63.40/barrel | Slightly higher |\n| Gold Futures | $4,975/oz | +2% |\n| Silver Futures | ~$77/oz | Recovering |\n| Bitcoin | ~$70,700 | +10% from overnight lows |\n| U.S. Dollar Index | 97.63 | Slightly lower |\n\n### 5.6 IPO Activity\n\n**Once Upon a Farm (OFRM)** — Jennifer Garner's children's food company debuted on the NYSE, pricing its IPO at $18/share, raising ~$200 million with an implied market cap of ~$724 million.\n\n*Sources: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-and-p-500-02062026-11901010), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/global-software-stocks-hit-by-anthropic-wake-up-call-ai-disruption-2026-02-04/), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Market Sentiment & Investor Reactions\n\n### Prevailing Themes\n\n1. **\"Buy the Dip\" Mentality Held**: Despite the worst three-day Nasdaq selloff since April, investors stepped in aggressively on Friday. The fact that 66 S&P 500 stocks hit 52-week highs shows broad participation beneath the tech weakness.\n\n2. **The \"Great Rotation\" is Accelerating**: Capital is moving decisively from growth/tech into value/cyclical sectors. This is being interpreted not as a market breakdown but as a healthy broadening.\n\n3. **AI Skepticism ≠ Market Bearishness**: Investors are becoming more selective about AI winners vs. losers, rather than abandoning the market entirely. Chipmakers (who supply the infrastructure) are gaining while software companies (potentially disrupted by AI) are losing.\n\n4. **Crypto Volatility**: Bitcoin's 50% drawdown from its peak followed by a sharp recovery to $70K+ shows extreme sentiment swings in risk assets.\n\n### Sentiment Indicators\n- **VIX/Fear**: Risk-off sentiment dominated earlier in the week, but Friday's broad rally indicates the fear was short-lived\n- **Breadth**: 66 stocks at new 52-week highs vs. only 11 at new 52-week lows in the S&P 500 — strongly positive breadth\n\n*Sources: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)*\n\n---\n\n## 7. Analyst Commentary & Expert Opinions\n\n### Bull Case\n\n> **Jeremy Siegel, Wharton Professor Emeritus**: \"This is probably one of the greatest technological revolutions that we've ever experienced. It's going to change the world.\" He said the Dow hitting 50,000 is a sign of \"a lot of fundamental strength in this economy\" and that the market broadening is \"just the beginning.\" ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html))\n\n> **Clark Bellin, Bellwether Wealth**: \"The bull market is not dead, but it is aging. 2026 should still be a positive year, with plenty of opportunities to buy stocks on sale.\" ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html))\n\n> **Tom Essaye, Sevens Report Research**: \"The negativity surrounding AI-related tech is getting pretty intense. If AI is more resilient than expected (which has been the case in each test so far over the past three years), then there are opportunities [for buying] developing.\" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n> **Seana Smith, Global X ETFs**: \"The bar for Big Tech remains extremely high. Markets are only rewarding AI investment when it is paired with clear, durable revenue growth.\" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n### Cautious/Rotation Camp\n\n> **Piper Sandler Analysts**: \"New momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors — Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks.\" ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-stock-sectors-buy-tech-software-sell-energy-industrials-ai-2026-2))\n\n> **Goldman Sachs Analysts**: \"The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally.\" They examined which industries are least exposed to AI automation. ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-stock-sectors-buy-tech-software-sell-energy-industrials-ai-2026-2))\n\n> **Bob Savage, BNY**: \"Software companies that adapt toward client-specific solutions and integrate AI as an enabler rather than a replacement should regain investor confidence.\" ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html))\n\n### Bear/Risk Warnings\n\n> **Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank**: \"Recent months have seen a shift from the 'every tech stock is a winner' mindset to a more brutal landscape of winners and losers.\" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n> **Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers**: \"Crowded trades are difficult to exit. Assets that have been granted premium valuations, whether through rational expectations or speculative fervor, are more prone to messy selloffs if perceptions and/or momentum change.\" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n> **Nick Dempsey, Barclays**: Called it \"just does not seem realistic\" that AI can fully supplant industry-specific software tools, but acknowledged that in markets this touchy, \"headlines about the possibility are clearly not helpful.\" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/markets/tech-stocks-meltdown-why))\n\n### Top Brokerage S&P 500 Targets for 2026\n\nPer Reuters, top brokerages expect the S&P 500 to extend its rally in 2026, with investors piling into AI plays and betting on reduced borrowing costs to sustain momentum.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Key Takeaways\n\n1. **The Dow hit 50,000 for the first time** — a historic milestone driven by broad-based buying in industrials, financials, energy, and consumer staples rather than the traditional tech leadership.\n\n2. **A massive sector rotation is underway** — the S&P 500 IT sector is the worst performer in 2026 (-6% YTD), while Energy (+15%), Consumer Staples (+11%), Industrials (+7%), and Banks (+7%) are leading.\n\n3. **AI is splitting into winners and losers** — chipmakers (Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom) are benefiting from insatiable infrastructure demand, while software companies (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Adobe) face existential disruption fears from Anthropic's agentic AI tools.\n\n4. **Big Tech's $200B+ capex plans are a double-edged sword** — they signal massive chip demand (bullish for semis) but concern investors about returns on investment (bearish for the hyperscalers themselves).\n\n5. **The bull market appears intact but changing character** — leadership is broadening from a narrow set of tech megacaps to a wider array of cyclical and value sectors, consistent with late-cycle market behavior.\n\n6. **Friday's rebound was sharp but doesn't erase the weekly damage** — the Nasdaq still ended the week lower for the fourth straight week, and the software selloff wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market value over the past week.\n\n---\n\n*Research compiled: February 7, 2026*\n*Sources: CNBC, CNN Business, Investopedia, Reuters, Bloomberg, Business Insider, Yahoo Finance*\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1,"output":5403,"cacheRead":33462,"cacheWrite":85,"totalTokens":38951,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.135075,"cacheRead":0.016731,"cacheWrite":0.00053125,"total":0.15234225}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770424098755}}
