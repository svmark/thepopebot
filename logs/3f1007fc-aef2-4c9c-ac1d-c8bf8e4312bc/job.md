Create a one-time scheduled reminder to send the message "Hey, Mark - This is a testing message" at 6:53 AM KST today (February 12, 2026). This will involve:

1. Calculate the exact time for 6:53 AM KST on February 12, 2026
2. Set up a mechanism to send the specified message at that time
3. The message should be sent exactly as specified: "Hey, Mark - This is a testing message"
4. This is a one-time reminder, not a recurring schedule

The job should handle timezone conversion properly and ensure the message is delivered at the correct time in Korean Standard Time.
