Our baseline expectation is for firm growth ahead, and with the federal funds rate now aligned with a range of neutral estimates, we expect the Federal Reserve to become more cautious about easing. (The neutral rate is the interest rate that would neither stimulate nor restrict economic activity.)\n\nU.S. economic momentum continues to be anchored by robust capital outlays, which have played a central role in driving growth over the past year. We expect business investment to remain a major source of strength in 2026. A significant part of this support comes from the rapid expansion of AI‑related spending, which we estimate to still be in the early stages.\n\nRecent data have provided positive signs of continued disinflation. Some modest tariff-related impacts will still likely filter through early this year, and we expect core inflation to crest slightly above 3% before easing later in the year.\n\nJob creation has cooled considerably over the past year. Even so, we believe the underlying labor backdrop remains stable. We assess that demographic dynamics and immigration flows explain about 70% of a recent hiring slowdown, rather than a deterioration in labor demand. We see the unemployment rate firming toward 4.2% by the end of 2026.\n\n## United States economic forecasts\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: U.S. Hiring Starts the Year at a Strong Pace - The New York Times\nLink: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/11/business/jobs-report-economy\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: <strong>The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent and the economy added 130,000 jobs in January</strong>.

Those growth rates were not “numbers unheard of,” or figures the U.S. “never had” before, as President Donald Trump has claimed.\n\nIn addition, economic experts told us that federal data do not support Trump’s claim that there was economic “stagflation” during the Biden administration and “the complete opposite” during Trump’s first year back in office. Inflation was high during much of Joe Biden’s presidency, but economic growth was not stagnant, another key indicator of stagflation, the experts said. \n\nThey also said that Trump’s tariff policies likely hindered economic growth, rather than helped spur it, as the president has suggested. \n\nTrump made those claims while touting the U.S. economy in recent speeches and remarks, as well as in a late January opinion piece written for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nDuring a Jan. 27 [speech](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-economy-energy-clive-iowa-january-27-2026/) in Iowa, Trump said, “So, under my leadership, economic growth is exploding to numbers unheard of. They’ve never had them before.”\n\nHe later said in [an interview](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-tom-llamas-nbc-news-february-4-2026/#365) with NBC News on [Feb. 4](https://youtu.be/rT6eucDVmFY?si=ruC7Zho8b2Zj1sKU&t=16), “We have low inflation and we have tremendous growth. You haven’t had these numbers like this.”\n\nAnd when claiming to have achieved “unprecedented” growth numbers in a Jan. 29 Cabinet [meeting](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-cabinet-meeting-january-29-2026/) at the White House, Trump said that if not for the [43-day](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/12/congress/trump-signs-bill-ending-longest-government-shutdown-in-us-history-00650189) federal government shutdown last fall, **“**we would have picked up about a point and a half more than \\[the\\] already high numbers, record setting numbers.”\n\nWhile the U.S. economy grew significantly in the second and third quarters of 2025, [according to](https://perma.cc/9DQR-APL2) the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the numbers did not set records, as Trump claimed.\n\nAfter declining by an annualized rate of [0.6%](https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/gdp3q25-updated.pdf) in the first quarter of 2025, which covers the three months from January to March, real gross domestic product (meaning it has been adjusted for inflation) grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025 and at a rate of 4.4% in the third quarter.

But the data also had revised figures that paint an even weaker picture of last year’s performance. It comes as some corporations like Amazon and UPS are announcing layoffs. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Harry Holzer, a former chief economist for the Department of Labor.\n\n_Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors._\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nThe U.S. economy opened 2026 on better footing, with the latest jobs report showing employers added 130,000 jobs in January. And the unemployment rate edged down to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent in December, a stronger-than-expected result for last month.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nBut the data also had newly revised figures that paint an even weaker picture of last year's performance. The U.S. economy added just 181,000 net jobs last year, about 400,000 fewer than initially reported, and far from the 1.4 million jobs added in 2024.\n\nThis all comes as some corporations like Amazon and UPS are announcing tens of thousands of layoffs.\n\nTo break down all these numbers. And what it all means for the U.S. economy, we're joined now by Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. He's a former chief economist for the Department of Labor.\n\nThanks for being here. We appreciate it.\n\nHarry Holzer, Professor of Public Policy, Georgetown University: Thank you. Nice to be here.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nSo we should say 130,000 jobs added is not a strong number. Not long ago, that number would have been reported as underwhelming. Why have the goalposts shifted?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nWell, because job growth all of last year was so weak. So compared to a lot of the weakness we saw in 2025, 130,000 is a pretty good number.\n\nSo relative to that. But another misleading thing about that, and this has been true for a while, almost all of the job creation is limited to a few key sectors, like health care, social assistance, and, this month, construction and professional services. There were other sectors that actually had job loss.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nAnd what are those? What sectors remain under pressure?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nLast month, we saw declines in information technology, in financial services, and continuing declines in the federal government, federal government because of DOGE activities and other cutbacks. Federal government shed about 300,000 workers last year.\n\nThey dropped another 33,000 to 34,000 last month.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nAnd the revisions to last year's numbers are also striking. Just 181,000 jobs were added in 2025. That's about 14 percent of the gains that we saw in 2024. What does that say about the underlying strength of the economy?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nWell, the economy weakened in 2025. There was so much uncertainty. The policy environment was so chaotic, tariffs and immigration cuts and things like that. I think employers face less consumer demand in the market, and they just had so much uncertainty about what was going to happen month to month that they cut way back.\n\nOf course, the other factor was less immigrant -- fewer immigrants coming into the market, and therefore fewer workers available for being hired.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nAnd there's been a surge in corporate layoffs, as we mentioned. The global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released a report that said layoffs were 118 percent higher compared with January of 2025.\n\nWhat kind of warning sign does that send? Or is this a normalization after pandemic era overexpansion?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nI think, for the tech sector, for companies like Amazon, some of it is normalization and that's been going on for a few years already. But some of it is they have invested very heavily in A.I. with the idea that they're going to -- that's going to save them on labor costs and they want to start seeing the returns on that investment.\n\nSo they're announcing some cutbacks. More broadly, we're not seeing an enormous number of layoffs, but they are a bit higher, certainly relative to a year ago and even relative to last month. You see some uptick in layoffs. Most of the decline has been new hiring, rather than layoffs, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nYes. You could argue we're not in a recession, but for a lot of workers and Americans generally, it might feel like one.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the former Fed economist, she noted that the 181,000 jobs you mentioned earlier in an economy of 158 million is basically nothing. And then you have the Fed Governor Chris Waller -- he's a Trump appointee -- he mentioned in his dissent that the recent payroll gains do not remotely look like a healthy labor market.\n\nIs this a cyclical cooling or is something more structural happening beneath the surface here?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nWe're not sure yet. And that's why from one month to the next, we keep watching\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: CPI data takes center stage in Friday’s economic calendar By Investing.com\nLink: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cpi-data-takes-center-stage-in-fridays-economic-calendar-93CH-4503836\nAge: 10 hours ago\nSnippet: CPI data takes center stage in Friday’s economic calendar\nContent:\n(HTTP 403)\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770958852555}}

A sustained hold above this base, followed by a breakout above ₹1,60,800, could revive bullish momentum towards ₹1,65,000 – ₹1,75,000. Medium-term outlook remains positive despite volatility,” he added.\n\n## **Silver Price Outlook**\n\nCOMEX [silver](https://www.livemint.com/silver-prices) price is currently trading in the $80–$87 zone after a steep correction from record highs above $121. While the higher timeframe structure remains bullish, the sharp pullback has pushed prices below key moving averages, reflecting short-term bearish pressure.\n\n“Strong buying interest is observed in the $65–$70 support band, aligned with prior swing lows and long-term trend support. A sustained hold above this base, followed by a recovery and close above $85–$92, could revive upside momentum towards $95–$105 and eventually a retest of previous highs.

South Korean shares hit an all-time high fueled by the global surge in AI-driven chip demand, while Singaporean stocks surpassed the 5,000-point mark as capital flowed into diversified sectors beyond technology. Consequently, the MSCI index of emerging Asian equities climbed roughly 0.7% to a new peak, anchored by a 3% record-breaking surge in the KOSPI.\n\nThe semiconductor industry acted as a primary engine for these gains. Major players Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix saw their share prices jump by 6.4% and 3.3%, respectively, propelling the South Korean benchmark upward for the fourth day in a row.\n\nIn Japan, the financial landscape saw a rare synchronized rally of stocks, government bonds, and the yen as investors reacted to Sanae Takaichi’s historic election as Prime Minister. The Nikkei 225 broke the 58,000 threshold for the first time, hitting an intraday record of 58,015.08 before cooling off to close slightly lower at 57,639.84. Despite the late-day dip, the index has gained nearly 15% so far in 2026, while the broader Topix index rose 0.7% to settle at 3,882.16.\n\nCorporate performance within Japan remained a mixed bag. Shiseido experienced its largest stock surge since 2008 climbing 15.8% on the news of a projected return to profitability.\n\nConversely, Honda Motor saw its shares drop 3.5% following a weak earnings report. Market attention is now shifting toward SoftBank Group, which is expected to release results that clarify the financing strategy for its ambitious AI investment portfolio.\n\n**Most Read:** [**Chart alert: Nikkei 225 bullish acceleration intact towards 60,000 in the first step**](https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-nikkei-225-bullish-acceleration-intact-towards-60000-in-the-first-step/)\n\n## European Session - European shares advance on earnings\n\nEuropean equity markets climbed to unprecedented heights on Thursday, spearheaded by a rally in French benchmarks as a string of upbeat corporate earnings reports bolstered confidence.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 edged up 0.7% to reach 625.86 points, while the CAC 40 outpaced its peers with a gain of more than 1.4%.\n\nSpecific corporate success stories drove much of the morning's momentum. Shares of Legrand rose 3.3% following the company's announcement that the booming data center market is fueling its expansion, allowing for an upward revision of its medium-term profitability goals. Similarly, luxury powerhouse Hermes saw its stock climb 2.3% after reporting consistent revenue growth, underpinned by robust consumer demand in both Japan and the United States.\n\nBroader market sentiment was further supported by a sense of international relief. Investors reacted positively to recent US labor data, which indicated a resilient job market, effectively overshadowing recent anxieties regarding AI-driven market volatility. This shift in focus allowed equities to regain their footing after several sessions of uncertainty.\n\nMerger and acquisition activity provided an additional jolt to the financial sector. Shares of British money manager Schroders skyrocketed 30% after US-based Nuveen announced an agreement to acquire the firm for £9.9 billion ($13.5 billion). The deal, which creates a combined entity managing nearly $2.5 trillion in assets, pushed the broader financial services sector up by 1.4%, making it the day's top-performing industry group.\n\nOn the FX front, the Japanese yen surged on Thursday, positioning itself for its most significant weekly gain in over a year. This resurgence has placed notable pressure on the US dollar, signaling a potential sentiment shift in global currency markets.\n\nThe yen climbed approximately 2.8% against the greenback and over 2% against the euro this week. While the dollar index edged slightly lower.\n\nIn other regions, the Australian dollar reached a three-year peak of $0.7146. This rally follows a series of interest rate hikes by the central bank, which has signaled that more tightenin\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Stocks drop with tech slide and caution over inflation; yields also fall | Reuters\nLink: https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2026-02-12/\nAge: 7 hours ago\nSnippet: An index of world stocks was sharply lower after hitting record highs this week.

Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update).

The real estate sector also suffered after some comments from Elon Musk about sending it into space.\n\nAdditionally, a Russian memo hints at more collaboration between the country and the US related to energy and minerals, and even the possibility of Russia returning to the USD system.\n\nFinally, the solid United States (US) Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report came back to play. The upbeat figures boosted the USD temporarily, but without some additional help, the Greenback had no room to run. The latest catalyst added to the USD bullish case was triggered on Wednesday by the NFP report.\n\nMarket players are also awaiting the release of the US January Consumer Price Index (CPI). Inflation is foreseen as mixed, with expectations of steady 0.3% monthly inflation and a modest yearly downtick expected, which cannot really affect future [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) decisions.\n\nBack to Gold, the bright metal is incapable of benefiting from the risk-averse environment; volatility around the bright metal, however, is high, with the price now trading over $70,00 above the intraday low.\n\n### XAU/USD short-term technical outlook\n\n![Chart Analysis XAU/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-analysis-1770915633053&w=1536&q=95)\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the 4-hour chart for XAU/USD shows the risk skewed to the downside. The 20‑period Simple Moving Average (SMA) has started to flatten after a steady climb, remaining above the slower 100‑ and 200‑period SMAs. Price sits below the 20 and 100 SMAs, providing resistance in the $5,012.12 - $5,049.90 band, while the 200 SMA offers dynamic support at $4,769.06. At the same time, technical indicators turned sharply bearish, heading south almost vertically within negative levels, reflecting mounting selling pressure.\n\nIn the daily chart, XAU/USD briefly pierced the bullish 20-day SMA before recovering above it, but remains nearby, with the SMA currently at $4,952.06. The longer moving averages are still too far below the shorter one to be relevant, while maintaining their upward slopes. Finally, the Momentum indicator is piercing its midline, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator also turned lower, currently standing at 53, both suggesting lower lows ahead.\n\n_(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)_\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Gold Price per Ounce in US Dollar (USD) Today\nLink: https://goldpricez.com/\nAge: 15 hours ago\nSnippet: Live Gold Price per Ounce in USD.

Earlier in the day, Applied Materials (AMAT) reported strong first-quarter results, citing high demand related to AI. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether the current market downturn is a temporary pullback or the beginning of a more sustained correction.\nContent:\n## Market Rout Deepens as Tech Sector Woes Continue\n\nU.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn on Thursday, February 12, 2026, as investors continued to grapple with the long-term implications of artificial intelligence and a mixed bag of corporate earnings. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite bore the brunt of the sell-off, while the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average and the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") also closed firmly in the red. The market's slide reflected a growing sentiment of caution, with traders taking profits after a recent run-up and re-evaluating the near-term profitability of the much-hyped AI sector.\n\n## Indexes Tumble in Broad-Based Sell-Off\n\nAt the closing bell, the S&P 500 had fallen by approximately 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed around 1.1% of its value. The Nasdaq Composite experienced the steepest decline, plunging by about 1.7% as investors soured on some high-flying tech names. This downward momentum suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment, as the initial euphoria surrounding AI gives way to a more critical assessment of which companies will truly benefit.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the market's \"fear gauge,\" saw a notable increase, reflecting the growing uncertainty among investors. Trading volume was robust, indicating a high level of conviction behind the day's selling pressure.\n\n## AI Darlings Face Scrutiny, Dragging Tech Down\n\nA key theme of the day's trading was the re-evaluation of companies at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution. While the long-term potential of AI remains a powerful narrative, concerns are emerging about the immediate path to profitability and the potential for disruption across various industries.\n\nAppLovin ([APP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/APP)), a mobile technology company, saw its stock plummet by a staggering 18.3% despite reporting profits that exceeded analyst expectations. This sharp decline was fueled by investor anxiety that the rise of AI could fundamentally alter the landscape of internet usage and potentially undermine AppLovin's business model.\n\nSimilarly, networking giant Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) experienced a significant 11.6% drop in its share price. The company's forecast for profit margins raised red flags for investors, who interpreted it as a sign of escalating costs associated with the AI arms race, particularly for essential components like computer memory.\n\n## Bright Spots Emerge Amidst the Gloom\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly negative sentiment, there were pockets of strength in the market. Fast-food behemoth McDonald's ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) saw its stock rise by approximately 2.2% after the company posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits. The positive results were largely attributed to the success of its value and affordability initiatives, which have resonated with consumers.\n\nRetail giant Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) also provided a boost to the S&P 500, with its shares rallying by a solid 2.9%. The company's strong performance suggests that consumers are increasingly focused on value, a trend that could benefit discount retailers in the current economic climate.\n\n## Earnings and Economic Data on the Horizon\n\nLooking ahead, investors are eagerly awaiting a fresh batch of economic data that could provide further clues about the health of the economy and the future direction of monetary policy. Key releases to watch include the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) and employment data. These figures will be closely scrutinized by the Federal Reserve as it considers its next move on interest rates.\n\nAfter the closing bell, several companies were slated to release their latest earnings reports. Among the most anticipated were results from companies in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. These reports will offer valuable insights into corporate profitability and guidance for the coming months.\n\nIn after-hours trading, PG&E Corporation ([PCG](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/PCG)) reported solid financial results for 2025 and provided an updated outlook for 2026. Brookfield Corporation ([BN](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/BN)) also announced strong earnings and a dividend increase. Meanwhile, Entergy Corporation ([ETR](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/ETR)) released its 2025 earnings and initiated its guidance for the current year. Earlier in the day, Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/AMAT)) reported strong first-quarter results, citing high demand related to AI.\n\nThe coming days will be crucial in determining whether the current market downturn is a temporary pullback or the beginning of a more sustained correction.

Corporate earnings from Applied Materials (after-hours Thursday showed strong AI demand), Arista Networks, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook\n\n**Market sentiment**: Risk-off tone dominated Thursday's session as investors reassessed the AI narrative. What was once a tailwind has become a headwind, with concerns mounting about disruption rather than opportunity across multiple sectors. The selloff was broad-based but technology-focused, with the Nasdaq bearing the brunt.\n\n**Key themes**: \n1. **AI disruption anxiety** — Markets are pivoting from AI euphoria to calculating which businesses will be displaced. Sectors from software to wealth management to logistics are facing downward pressure.\n2. **Labor market paradox** — January's solid 130K jobs added masks the underlying weakness revealed in 2025 revisions, suggesting the economy was far weaker than believed throughout last year.\n3. **Rate cut recalibration** — Strong employment data has pushed back expectations for Fed easing, though one June cut still anticipated.\n4. **Defensive rotation** — Investors moving into consumer staples and utilities, suggesting reduced risk appetite.\n5. **Friday's CPI critical** — Inflation data could swing sentiment either way, though with jobs strong, Fed may tolerate slightly elevated inflation.\n\n**What to watch**: Friday's CPI report is the week's critical catalyst. Mixed expectations (steady 0.3% monthly, modest yearly downtick) mean results could surprise in either direction. Also monitor whether software and tech stocks find support or continue sliding, and whether AI disruption fears spread to additional sectors. Trading volume and VIX levels suggest conviction behind the selling pressure.\n\n**International factors**: U.S.-China trade truce potentially extending up to a year with Trump-Xi meeting expected in April. Russia hints at increased energy/mineral collaboration with U.S. and possible return to dollar system. House voted against Trump's Canadian tariffs via emergency authority.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
