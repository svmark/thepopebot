Create a simple "Hello, World!" Python script in the repository. The script should:

1. Create a new file called `hello_world.py` in the root directory
2. Include a basic Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
3. Add appropriate comments explaining what the script does
4. Make sure the file follows Python best practices (proper encoding, etc.)

The script should be executable and serve as a simple example Python file in the repository.
