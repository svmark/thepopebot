## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market sentiment**: Risk-off tone dominated Thursday's session as investors reassessed the AI narrative. What was once a tailwind has become a headwind, with concerns mounting about disruption rather than opportunity across multiple sectors. The selloff was broad-based but technology-focused, with the Nasdaq bearing the brunt.

**Key themes**: 
1. **AI disruption anxiety** — Markets are pivoting from AI euphoria to calculating which businesses will be displaced. Sectors from software to wealth management to logistics are facing downward pressure.
2. **Labor market paradox** — January's solid 130K jobs added masks the underlying weakness revealed in 2025 revisions, suggesting the economy was far weaker than believed throughout last year.
3. **Rate cut recalibration** — Strong employment data has pushed back expectations for Fed easing, though one June cut still anticipated.
4. **Defensive rotation** — Investors moving into consumer staples and utilities, suggesting reduced risk appetite.
5. **Friday's CPI critical** — Inflation data could swing sentiment either way, though with jobs strong, Fed may tolerate slightly elevated inflation.

**What to watch**: Friday's CPI report is the week's critical catalyst. Mixed expectations (steady 0.3% monthly, modest yearly downtick) mean results could surprise in either direction. Also monitor whether software and tech stocks find support or continue sliding, and whether AI disruption fears spread to additional sectors. Trading volume and VIX levels suggest conviction behind the selling pressure.

**International factors**: U.S.-China trade truce potentially extending up to a year with Trump-Xi meeting expected in April. Russia hints at increased energy/mineral collaboration with U.S. and possible return to dollar system. House voted against Trump's Canadian tariffs via emergency authority.
